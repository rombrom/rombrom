Proud dad who's been making and breaking the web for 20-odd years.

I have a background in interaction design and extensive experience in full stack web development. I get good vibes from intuitive interfaces, simple technology, and crisp design. I'm independent, curious, and always eager to learn. Strong opinions, weakly held. Strong values, strongly held.

Loves mentoring, technical direction, and shipping scalable, maintainable, and delightful software. Enjoys solving complex problemsâ€”but cares more about people than tech. Autonomy, responsibility, and collaboration are keys to growth. Seen it all, from table layouts and frames to blockchain and AI.
